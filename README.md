# Live Beat Monitor

An assistant for live performances with backing tracks.

## How to use

Create show folder, which will contain all your tracks. Note that name of this folder will be interpreted as show name.

Use track names to configure them. Available extensions:
- `.mp3` `.wav` - TRACK types, follow this naming pattern: `<position>-<title>-<bpm>-<counter_delay>`; eg. `1-Intro-80.50-00.50.wav`
- `.md` - TEXT types in development
