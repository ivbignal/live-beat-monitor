# Live Beat Monitor

An assistant for live performances with backing tracks.

## How to use

Create show folder, which will contain all your tracks. Note that name of this folder will be interpreted as show name.

Use track names to configure them. Available extensions:
- `.mp3` `.wav` - TRACK types, follow this naming pattern: `<position>-<title>-<bpm>-<counter_delay>`; eg. `1-Intro-80.50-00.50.wav`
- `.md` - TEXT types in development

Open a show folder in LiveBeatMonitor (ignore errors if present - they tell you about files that weren't able to process)

Navigate using arrow keys or `PgUp`/`PgDown`, hit `space` to play/pause, hit `enter` to stop and reset to beginning.

Use `Perform mode` button to toggle fullscreen window which you can place on the on-stage separate monitor or leave on main monitor of your laptop if you planning to place it in front of yout band on stage.

Use `[` and `]` to change font scale of text track.

Use `Esc` to toggle Perform mode.

Use `o` key to dive into open show folder selection dialog.
